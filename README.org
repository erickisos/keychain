#+title: Keychain Telegram Bot

#+begin_quote
For now, this project is still in development, but in the future is expected that you would be able to just clone it and deploy it on your own aws account.
#+end_quote


This is a simple telegram bot that would help you to keep your physical passwords (this means, bank pins, and some other combinations that you would thing as useful) stored in just one place.

** Development

The next steps will help you to generate the main layer directory

- =mkdir -p dist/python/=
- =uv export --no-dev --format requirements.txt > requirements.txt=
- =uv pip install . -t dist/python/=

Once that you have the layer generated, you can test it locally by running

#+begin_src shell
sam local start-api
#+end_src
